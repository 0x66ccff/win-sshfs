WinSshFS FiSSH edition
========================

This fork is a project from a group of university students. The project ended in February 2015 therefore we will not update it anymore. However we hope that other developer improve our open-source software further. If you want to contribute check our unfinished issues and create a new fork.


This project is a new version of „WinSshFS 4every1“ which can be found at https://github.com/dimov-cz/win-sshfs.
Our prime objective was to change the graphical user interface to improve user-friendliness.

Main changes we made:
-completely redesigned the GUI  
-created a hierarchy to separate between server and their folders (mount directory) to add multiple   
  folders to one server easily
-added a command line to automate the program without the GUI
-server and file arrangement can be changed via drag&drop
-program can now start with windows startup
