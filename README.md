========================

This is fork of [dimov-cz/win-sshfs](https://github.com/dimov-cz/win-sshfs)  
As original project seems abandoned, i've made some changes to my needs here:

*   Ability to use Proxy for connections
*   Send Keepalive packets. (Not configurable, each 60sec hardcoded)

Check [commits](https://github.com/sepich/win-sshfs/commits/devel) section for details.  
You can get compiled binary in [releases](https://github.com/sepich/win-sshfs/releases).
